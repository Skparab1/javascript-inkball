 - Inkball is a video game developed by Microsoft. In the game, you try to direct balls into holes of corresponding colors by drawing lines which the balls bounce off.
 - This game is inkball written in JavaScript

- The ball animation is actually much smoother than what it shows because the gif's frame rate is low

    - bounces in correct direction off of walls
    - balls bounce off of each other in correct angle
    - bounces in WRONG direction when it hits lines

  - getting into hole
    - works
    - tells when ball in wrong hole
