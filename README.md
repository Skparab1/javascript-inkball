# javascript-inkball

- The video game inkball in JavaScript

- drawing and ball moving works well
  - however, only 4 lines can be drawn at one time
  - 4 lines should be enough but i can increase it

![](inkball_gif2.gif)

the ball animation is actually much smoother than what it shows because the gif's frame rate is low

fyi i'm using the processing editor for this project

latest commit will likely be unstable.
