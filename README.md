- The ball animation is actually much smoother than what it shows because the gif's frame rate is low

  - ball bouncing:
    - bounces in correct direction off of walls
    - balls bounce off of each other in correct angle
    - bounces in WRONG direction when it hits lines

fyi i'm using the processing editor for this project

latest commit will likely be unstable.
