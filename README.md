# Javascript inkball
 - Inkball is a video game developed by Microsoft. In the game, you try to direct balls into holes of corresponding colors by drawing lines which the balls bounce off.

- The ball animation is actually much smoother than what it shows because the gif's frame rate is low

  - ball bouncing:
    - bounces in correct direction off of walls
    - balls bounce off of each other in correct angle
    - bounces in WRONG direction when it hits lines

  - getting into hole
    - works

fyi i'm using the processing editor for this project

latest commit will likely be unstable.
